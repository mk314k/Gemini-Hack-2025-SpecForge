# Spec-to-Reality: Instant Product Factory

**Turn your ideas into engineering reality in seconds.**

Spec-to-Reality is a hackathon project that leverages the latest **Google Gemini 3** and **Nano Banana Pro** models to transform a simple natural language description into a full-blown engineering design packet. It acts as an instant "Product Factory," generating structured specs, technical blueprints, and validation reports automatically.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Instant Engineering Specs**: Converts vague ideas into rigorous JSON-structured engineering specifications (BOM, constraints, assembly steps).
*   **AI Blueprints (Nano Banana Pro)**: Generates blueprint-style technical diagrams (Top View, Exploded View, UI Mockups) using `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`.
*   **Self-Correction Loop**: Uses Gemini 3 to "audit" its own work, comparing the generated specs against the visual diagrams to find physical inconsistencies and suggesting fixes.
*   **Design Packet Export**: One-click download of a self-contained HTML design packet containing all specs, images, and reports.
*   **Examples Library**: Includes a set of pre-generated design packets in the `examples/` folder to demonstrate capability without running the model.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React 19 (via Vite), TypeScript
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
*   **AI SDK**: `@google/genai` (Google Generative AI SDK for Node/Web)
*   **State Management**: React Hooks + LocalStorage (for Recent Designs)
*   **Build Tool**: Vite

## 🤖 Google AI Models Used

This project specifically utilizes the **Gemini 2.5 / 3.0** family of models:

1.  **Reasoning & Logic**: `gemini-3-pro-preview`
    *   **Task**: Drafting the Spec.
    *   **Usage**: Takes the user prompt and product type, applies a strict JSON schema, and hallucinates a detailed component list and requirements doc.
    *   **Task**: Self-Check Audit.
    *   **Usage**: Reads the generated spec + image descriptions to find logical fallacies (e.g., "Battery is too heavy for the specified drone frame").

2.  **Vision & Generation**: `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` (aka Nano Banana Pro)
    *   **Task**: Technical Diagrams.
    *   **Usage**: Generates high-fidelity, schematic-style technical drawings (Top/Side/Exploded views) based on the `diagramsPlan` created by the reasoning model.

## 📂 Project Structure

*   `src/components`: React UI components.
    *   `InputForm.tsx`: The main chat-like interface.
    *   `DesignDisplay.tsx`: The rendering engine for the output packet.
*   `src/services`: Client-side AI service layer (`gemini.ts`) handling API calls.
*   `examples/`: Contains sample downloadable design packets generated by the tool. (See this folder for reference outputs).

## ⚡ How to Run

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run Locally**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  **API Key**:
    The app requires a **Google Cloud Project API Key** with billing enabled (for the Image Generation model). You will be prompted to select this key via the secure Google AI Studio popup upon launching the app.
